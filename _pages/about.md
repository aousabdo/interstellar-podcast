Welcome to the Interstellar Podcast. I'm Dr. Aous Abdo, and I'm excited to take you on a journey through the cosmos, exploring the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and astrophysics. But before we launch into the stars, let me share a bit about the boy who dreamed of flying.

From a young age, science wasn't just a subject for me—it was an obsession. I was that kid who didn't quite fit in at school, but who spent countless hours dreaming about flight and tinkering with homemade RC airplanes. With very limited resources, I'd try year after year to bring my designs to life. It wasn't always easy, and there were plenty of crash landings, but each failure only fueled my determination.

My passion for science, particularly astrophysics and technology, was a constant companion through those early years. While I might not have been the model student in traditional subjects, I knew deep down that one day, I'd find my place among the stars.

That drive led me to pursue a Ph.D. in Physics from Michigan State University. It was a long journey from that boy with handmade planes to leading research teams at NASA, but the wonder and curiosity remained the same. Whether I was uncovering the secrets of gamma-ray sources or pushing the boundaries of AI applications in defense and national security, I've always felt like that kid, eyes wide with possibilities.

*Standing atop the Parkes telescope in Australia, I felt as close to fulfilling my childhood dreams as ever*

One of my proudest achievements was being the first to discover Einstein rings in gamma rays—a form of gravitational lensing—using NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. This discovery opened up new avenues for studying the cosmos and testing Einstein's theory of general relativity in extreme conditions.

## Notable Research: The B1259 Binary System

Another exciting chapter in my career was our work on the B1259 binary system. In 2010, I assembled a team of world-renowned scientists to observe the collision of two stars in this system. This massive undertaking put me in command of major space telescopes including Fermi, Swift, Hubble, and Suzaku, as well as numerous ground-based observatories. We utilized the Parkes telescope in Australia, the Australia Telescope Compact Array in Narrabri, and many others across the globe.

Our team's groundbreaking observations led to the discovery of dual gamma-ray flares, significantly advancing our understanding of high-mass binaries. This work garnered significant attention, leading to multiple interviews on radio and television, where I had the opportunity to share our findings with the public through this [NASA interview](https://www.nasa.gov/universe/odd-couple-binary-makes-dual-gamma-ray-flares/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

## Global Impact and Outreach

These experiences have only deepened my love for science and my desire to push the boundaries of our knowledge. Today, as the CEO of Analytica Data Science Solutions, I'm exploring new frontiers where AI and astrophysics meet. It's a thrilling time to be at this intersection, watching as machine learning algorithms help us process vast amounts of cosmic data, revealing patterns and phenomena we've never seen before.

My passion for learning continues unabated. I'm always acquiring new skills and reading voraciously, driven by the same curiosity that propelled me as a child. My work has taken me across the globe, from Germany to Australia, igniting the same passion for science in others that I've felt all my life.

Amidst all the cosmic wonders, my greatest joy comes from my family. My wife Linda, an incredibly talented artist, and our three young children keep me grounded and inspired. They remind me daily of the wonder in both the vast universe and in the small, precious moments we share.

## The Interstellar Podcast: Where AI Meets the Cosmos

This podcast is born from a desire to share these wonders with you—from the marvels of the cosmos to the cutting-edge of AI. In each episode, we'll explore the latest breakthroughs in science and technology, dive into mysterious astrophysical phenomena, and discuss how data science is reshaping our understanding of the universe.

I invite you to join me on this cosmic journey. Whether you're a seasoned scientist, a curious student, or someone who's ever looked up at the night sky in awe, there's a place for you here. Together, we'll explore the vastness of space and the limitless potential of human ingenuity.

For those who want to dive deeper, you can find more of my thoughts on AI and data science on the [Analytica Blog](https://analyticadss.com/blog/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. If you're interested in the technical side of my research, check out my [INSPIRE-HEP profile](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1049895){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} profile.
